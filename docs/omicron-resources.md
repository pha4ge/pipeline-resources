# Overview

The [World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 variant as a Variant of Concern (VOC)](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern) under the advice of the [Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE)](https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-sars-cov-2-virus-evolution)—an independent group of experts that periodically monitors and evaluates the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and assess if specific mutations and combinations of mutations alter the behavior of the virus. The WHO has assigned the B.1.1.529 VOC the label Omicron per [their greek-letter key variant assignment system](https://www.who.int/news/item/31-05-2021-who-announces-simple-easy-to-say-labels-for-sars-cov-2-variants-of-interest-and-concern).  The elevation of Omicron to a WHO-designated VOC was based on the TAG-VE's assessment of the variant’s large number of genomic mutations and plausible impact on COVID-19 epidemiology. 

The PHA4GE Pipelines and Visualization Working Group has created this document to highlight critical open-source/accesses resources to aid in the understanding and further analysis of the Omicron variant. 

In no way does this document represent a comprehensive list of all available SC2 bioinformatics resources. If this document fails to include a valuable public health resource or in some way mischaracterizes a resource mentioned, we encourage community collaboration through pull-requests and/or raised GitHub issues.

# Potential Impacts of Spike Protein Mutations

The spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant contains approximately 32 mutations, many of which have not been observed in previous VOCs. However, based on their location, several of these mutations have the potential to impact immune escape, transmissibility, and detection. Spike mutations found in the Omicron VOC can be analyzed in detail using the [Stanford University Coronavirus Antiviral & Resistance Database](https://covdb.stanford.edu/sierra/sars2/by-patterns/).

![Omicron S-gene mutations](./images/omicron_standford.svg)

- Up to 15 mutations have been observed within the receptor binding domain (RBD). The RBD region of the Spike protein interacts directly with the human receptor ACE2 and mutations in this region may have a direct impact on how well SARS-CoV-2 viral particles attach to a host cell. 

- Approximately 8 mutations have been observed within the N-terminal domain (NTD). The NTD of the Spike protein aids in virus attachment and mutations in this region could also impact virus infectivity. 

- Both the RBD and NTD are surface exposed areas of the Spike protein that are targeted by antibodies. Mutations in these regions have the potential to evade immunity by antibodies acquired through previous infection or vaccination.

- Three mutations occur near the furin cleavage site, the region of the Spike protein responsible for viral-host membrane fusion. Mutations in this region have the potential to affect viral entry into host cells.

## Diagnostic and Sequencing Assays

Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome can affect PCR-based diagnostic assays and genomic sequencing. For example, the ThermoFisher TaqPath probe targeting the Spike gene is known to result in S-gene target failure (SGTF) when amplifying nucleic acid preparations from VOC Alpha. This occurs when the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains a deletion resulting in the loss of amino acids 69-70 of the NTD. When coupled with the positive amplification of other SARS-CoV-2 genetic regions, the SGTF has been used as a diagnostic indicator of VOC presence [SGF Deletion Assay](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.25.465706v1.full). 

- [Thermo Fisher Scientific Confirms Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in Samples Containing the Omicron Variant with its TaqPath COVID-19 Tests](https://thermofisher.mediaroom.com/2021-11-29-Thermo-Fisher-Scientific-Confirms-Detection-of-SARS-CoV-2-in-Samples-Containing-the-Omicron-Variant-with-its-TaqPath-COVID-19-Tests): The Omicron variant contains the NTD deletion at amino acids 69/70 and results in SGTF by the TaqPath PCR assay. 

- [NEB's Primer Monitor Tool](https://primer-monitor.neb.com/lineages): Monitor registered primer sets for overlapping sequence variants in Omicron.

- [SARS-CoV-2 Artic V4.1 update for Omicron variant](https://community.artic.network/t/sars-cov-2-v4-1-update-for-omicron-variant/342): Ten mutations in the Omicron VOC affect the Artic V4 primer scheme for whole genome sequencing. The Artic Network has designed 11 new primers to account for these mutations. 

 
# Bioinformatics Resources and Considerations
Genome assembly as well as clade and lineage assignment of Omicron variants should follow the same bioinformatics workflow recommendations outlined in this working group's [Bioinformatics Solutions for SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Analysis](https://github.com/jkspinler/pipeline-resources/edit/main/docs/omicron-resources.md) guidance document. Briefly, raw amplicon read data should be mapped to the Wuhan-1 reference genome and primer trimming performed before a consensus genome is called. Clade  annd lineage assignment can then be made by analyzing the resulting consensus genome assemblies with the [NextClade](https://clades.nextstrain.org/) and [Pangolin](https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/) software, respectively.

## Software Version Minimums
For laboraotires making clade and lineage assignements outside of the NextClade and Pangolin web applications, e.g. through a custom workflow available on CLI, Terra.Bio, or Galaxy Project, please ensure to utilize updated NextClade and Pangolin software capable of making an accurate Omicron clade and lineage designation:
- [NextClade Software Version 1.7.0](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases/tag/1.7.0) ([Dataset Tag >=2021-12-16T20:15:53Z](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/datasets.html))
  - [NextStrain Docker Container Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nextstrain/nextclade)
- [Pangolin Software Version 3.1.17](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin/releases/tag/v3.1.17) ([Constellations >=0.1.0](https://github.com/cov-lineages/constellations/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

## SARS-CoV-2 Multiple Sequence Alignments
Primer dropouts in Omicron sequence data may lead to errant evolutionary inferences when performing phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. A proposed work around to these dropout regions is to mask the spike region and adjust the molecular clock rate accordingly, as [performed by Trevor Bedford in a recent phylodynamic analysis](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1466102128343093248?s=20).
